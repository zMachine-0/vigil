      <h2>Permission Levels</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>True Owner</strong> — The actual Discord server owner only</li>
        <li><strong>Owner Level</strong> — True owner + /owner add users + owner role holders</li>
        <li><strong>Trusted Admin</strong> — Owner level + /tadmin add users + TA role holders</li>
        <li><strong>Everyone</strong> — Any server member</li>

      <h2>Owner Management</h2>

      <h3>/owner add [user]</h3>

      <p><span class="perm perm-true">True Owner</span></p>

      <h3>/owner remove [user]</h3>

      <p><span class="perm perm-everyone">Everyone</span></p>

      <h3>/owner setrole [role]</h3>
      <p>Assigns a Discord role that automatically grants owner-level access to anyone holding it.</p>
      <p><span class="perm perm-true">True Owner</span></p>

      <h3>/quarantine add [user]</h3>

      <h2>Moderation</h2>

      <p><span class="perm perm-tadmin">Trusted Admin</span></p>

      <h2>Backup Management</h2>
      <p><em>Backups capture full server structure: roles, channels (with permission overwrites), emojis, animated emojis, stickers, and server name.</em></p>

      <h3>/backup create [name]</h3>
      <p>Creates a new backup. If a backup with that name exists, confirms before overwriting. Names can only contain letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.</p>

      <h3>/backup list</h3>
      <p>Lists all backups with creation date, role count, channel count, emoji count, sticker count, and server name. Auto-backups are marked 🔄.</p>
      <p><span class="perm perm-owner">Owner Level</span></p>

      <h3>/backup load [name]</h3>
      <p>Restores a backup. Deletes all current channels and roles, then recreates everything including re-uploading emojis and stickers. <strong>This cannot be undone.</strong> Requires confirmation.</p>
      <p><span class="perm perm-owner">Owner Level</span></p>

      <h2>Verification</h2>

      <h3>/setupverify [channel] [role]</h3>
      <p>Sends a verification message with a Verify button. Members click it, receive a private 4-digit code, and submit it via a popup. On success they receive the chosen role. Codes expire after 5 minutes and the setup persists across bot restarts.</p>
      <p><span class="perm perm-owner">Owner Level</span></p>

      <h2>Auto Backup</h2>
      <p>Every midnight UTC, Vigil automatically creates a backup for every server, named:</p>
      <pre>AUTO_BACKUP-1st-Jan-2025</pre>
      <p>Auto-backups appear in <strong>/backup list</strong> marked with 🔄. Each day's copy overwrites the previous — only the most recent is kept per server.</p>

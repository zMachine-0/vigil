      <h1>🛡️ Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 2026 · Use of Vigil also implies agreement to the <a href="/vigil/terms/">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Vigil ("the Bot", "we", "us") collects, stores, uses, and protects data when used within Discord servers.</p>
      <p>By adding or using Vigil, you agree to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service.</p>

      <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Discord Server IDs and server name (stored in backups)</li>
        <li>Channel IDs and Role IDs</li>
        <li>User IDs (for whitelist, quarantine, and permission records)</li>
        <li>Quarantine reasons and timestamps</li>
        <li>Security event references (counted, not stored as content)</li>
        <li>Configuration settings (whitelists, thresholds, permissions)</li>
        <li>Server backup data (roles, channels, emojis, stickers, server name)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Vigil does <strong>not</strong> collect message content, direct messages, email addresses, passwords, IP addresses, or payment information.</p>

      <h2>3. Verification Codes</h2>
      <p>When a member clicks Verify, a temporary 4-digit code is held <strong>in memory only</strong> — never written to disk — for a maximum of 5 minutes. It is deleted immediately after use or expiry.</p>

      <h2>4. How Data Is Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Detecting raids and destructive activity</li>
        <li>Performing automated moderation actions</li>
        <li>Maintaining and restoring server backups</li>
        <li>Providing security scoring and activity logs</li>
        <li>Managing the permission hierarchy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Data is never used for advertising, profiling, analytics, or any purpose beyond core bot operation.</p>

      <h2>5. Automated Decision-Making</h2>
      <p>Vigil uses automated systems to detect suspicious behaviour and may automatically quarantine, ban, or restrict users. <strong>False positives can occur.</strong> Server administrators are responsible for reviewing and correcting automated actions.</p>

      <h2>6. Data Storage</h2>
      <p>All data is stored locally on the server hosting Vigil as plain-text JSON files. Data is <strong>not encrypted by default</strong>. The bot operator is responsible for securing the hosting environment and applying encryption at rest if required.</p>
      <p>Vigil uses atomic file writes to prevent corruption, sanitizes backup names to prevent path traversal, and auto-recovers corrupted files.</p>

      <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Whitelist / Owner / TA records</strong> — until removed via bot commands</li>
        <li><strong>Quarantine records</strong> — until the user is released</li>
        <li><strong>Backups</strong> — until manually deleted; daily auto-backups overwrite the previous copy</li>
        <li><strong>Verification codes</strong> — 5 minutes maximum, in memory only</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Removing Vigil from your server does <strong>not</strong> automatically delete stored data files. The bot operator is responsible for purging data for inactive servers.</p>

      <h2>8. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>Vigil does not sell, trade, or share data with any third party. Data may be disclosed if legally compelled by a valid court order or law enforcement request — only to the minimum extent required.</p>

      <h2>9. International Data Protection</h2>
      <p>Users and bot operators are responsible for complying with applicable data protection laws, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>GDPR</strong> (EU &amp; UK) — rights include access, erasure, rectification, restriction, and portability. Requests handled within 30 days.</li>
        <li><strong>CCPA</strong> (California, USA) — right to know, delete, and opt out of data sale. Vigil does not sell data.</li>
        <li>Other applicable local data protection regulations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10. Security Measures</h2>
      <p>The bot operator is responsible for securing server access with strong authentication, limiting file access to trusted operators, keeping hosting software up to date, and encrypting data at rest if the environment is shared or untrusted.</p>

      <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>As a server administrator, you can view, edit, or delete stored data using bot commands or by accessing the <code>data/</code> and <code>backups/</code> directories on the hosting server. As an individual member, you may request a server administrator remove your records, or contact the bot operator directly.</p>

      <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Continued use of Vigil after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

      <h2>13. Contact</h2>
      <p>For privacy concerns or data requests, contact the bot operator through the platform where Vigil is deployed. Include your Discord user ID and server name so records can be located promptly.</p>

      <h1>🛡️ Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 2026 · Use of Vigil also implies agreement to the <a href="/vigil/terms/">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains what data Vigil ("the Bot", "we", "us") collects, how it is stored, who can access it, how long it is kept, and your rights regarding it. By adding or using Vigil, you agree to this policy and the Terms of Service.</p>

      <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>Vigil collects and stores only the data required to operate its security and moderation features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Guild IDs</strong> — to scope all stored data to the correct server</li>
        <li><strong>Channel IDs</strong> — for log channel configuration and verification setup</li>
        <li><strong>Role IDs</strong> — for owner, trusted admin, whitelist, and verification role assignments</li>
        <li><strong>User IDs</strong> — for whitelist, quarantine, and permission records</li>
        <li><strong>Quarantine records</strong> — reason, timestamp, and saved role list per quarantined user</li>
        <li><strong>Configuration settings</strong> — thresholds, permission tiers, and feature toggles</li>
        <li><strong>Backup data</strong> — server name, full role list, channel structure, emojis, and stickers</li>
        <li><strong>Error logs</strong> — command names, timestamps, and guild identifiers for debugging purposes; user IDs are only included where directly relevant to the error</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Vigil does <strong>not</strong> collect message content, direct messages, email addresses, passwords, IP addresses, or payment information.</p>

      <h2>3. Verification Codes</h2>
      <p>When a member clicks Verify, a temporary 4-digit code is generated and held <strong>in memory only</strong> — never written to disk — for a maximum of 5 minutes. It is deleted immediately after use or expiry.</p>

      <h2>4. How Data Is Used</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Detecting and responding to raids, anti-nuke events, and other security threats</li>
        <li>Performing automated and manual moderation actions</li>
        <li>Maintaining and restoring server configuration backups</li>
        <li>Providing security scoring and activity logging</li>
        <li>Managing the three-tier permission hierarchy</li>
        <li>Developer debugging, maintenance, and schema migration</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Data is never used for advertising, profiling, or any purpose beyond operating the bot.</p>

      <h2>5. Who Has Access</h2>
      <p>Stored data is accessible to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Server administrators</strong> — via bot commands or direct access to the <code>data/</code> and <code>backups/</code> directories on the hosting server</li>
        <li><strong>The bot developer(s)</strong> — solely for maintenance, debugging, security, or data migration purposes. This includes inspecting corrupted backups, diagnosing restore failures, and performing global backup operations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No other parties have access to stored data.</p>

      <h2>6. Automated Decision-Making</h2>
      <p>Vigil uses automated systems to detect suspicious behaviour and may automatically quarantine, ban, or restrict users. <strong>False positives can occur.</strong> Server administrators are responsible for reviewing and correcting automated actions.</p>

      <h2>7. Data Storage</h2>
      <p>All data is stored locally on the server hosting Vigil as plain-text JSON files. <strong>Data is not encrypted by default.</strong> The bot operator is responsible for securing the hosting environment, restricting file access, and applying encryption at rest if required.</p>
      <p>Vigil uses atomic file writes to prevent corruption, sanitizes backup names to prevent path traversal, and auto-recovers from corrupted files where possible.</p>

      <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Whitelist / Owner / TA records</strong> — until removed via bot commands</li>
        <li><strong>Quarantine records</strong> — until the user is released</li>
        <li><strong>Permanent backup slots (1–5)</strong> — until overwritten by a new backup in that slot</li>
        <li><strong>Auto backup slots (AB1–AB3)</strong> — rolling 3-day history; the slot being written to overwrites its previous file each cycle</li>
        <li><strong>Verification codes</strong> — 5 minutes maximum, held in memory only</li>
        <li><strong>Error logs</strong> — retained at the discretion of the bot operator; not stored in a separate log file by default (printed to console only)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Removing Vigil from your server does <strong>not</strong> automatically delete stored data files. The bot operator is responsible for purging data for inactive servers. Data may also be deleted by the developer during maintenance, migration, or following prolonged inactivity.</p>

      <h2>9. Backup Operations by the Developer</h2>
      <p>The developer may trigger backup operations across all guilds for maintenance, security, or migration purposes. These operations follow the same round-robin slot system (AB1/AB2/AB3) as scheduled daily backups and are logged to each guild's configured log channel. No additional data is collected during these operations.</p>

      <h2>10. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>Vigil does not sell, trade, or share data with any third party. Data may be disclosed if legally compelled by a valid court order or law enforcement request — only to the minimum extent required, and only where legally permitted.</p>

      <h2>11. International Data Protection</h2>
      <p>Users and bot operators are responsible for complying with applicable data protection laws, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>GDPR</strong> (EU &amp; UK) — rights include access, erasure, rectification, restriction, and portability. Requests handled within 30 days.</li>
        <li><strong>CCPA</strong> (California, USA) — right to know, delete, and opt out of data sale. Vigil does not sell data.</li>
        <li>Other applicable local data protection regulations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>12. Security Measures</h2>
      <p>The bot operator is responsible for: securing server access with strong authentication, limiting file access to trusted operators, keeping hosting software up to date, and encrypting data at rest if the environment is shared or untrusted.</p>

      <h2>13. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>As a server administrator, you can view, edit, or delete stored data using bot commands or by accessing the data files directly on the hosting server. As an individual member, you may request a server administrator remove your records, or contact the bot operator directly.</p>

      <h2>14. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Continued use of Vigil after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

      <h2>15. Contact</h2>
      <p>For privacy concerns, data requests, or to report a data issue, contact the bot operator through Vigil's suppoer server. Include your Discord user ID and server name so records can be located promptly.</p>

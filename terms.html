<h1>Vigil — Terms of Service</h1>

<blockquote>
<strong>Plain Language Summary:</strong> By adding Vigil to your server, you agree to use it responsibly and within Discord's own rules. Vigil takes automated security actions — these can occasionally produce false positives, and it is the server admin's job to review and correct them. The bot operator is not liable for data loss or moderation mistakes. Both this document and the <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> apply when you use Vigil.
</blockquote>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By adding Vigil ("the Bot", "we", "us") to your Discord server or using any of its features, you ("the User", "Server Administrator", "Member") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms") and the <a href="privacy.html">Vigil Privacy Policy</a>. Both documents apply. If you do not agree to either, do not add or use Vigil.</p>

<p>These Terms apply to all users of Vigil, including server administrators, owners, Trusted Admins, and regular members.</p>

<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least 13 years of age and comply with <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank">Discord's Terms of Service</a> to use Vigil. By using the Bot, you confirm that you meet these requirements. If you are between 13 and 18 years of age, you confirm that you have the consent of a parent or legal guardian.</p>

<h2>3. Description of Service</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automated anti-nuke and anti-raid protection</li>
<li>Server backup and restore functionality (roles, channels, emojis, stickers, server name)</li>
<li>Quarantine and moderation tools (ban, kick, timeout)</li>
<li>Three-tier permission management system</li>
<li>Member verification gate with 4-digit code confirmation</li>
<li>Security scoring and threat monitoring</li>
</ul>

<p>Vigil is provided <strong>as-is</strong> and may change at any time without prior notice.</p>

<h2>4. Permitted Use</h2>

<li>Reverse-engineering or tampering with the Bot</li>
<li>Illegal activity</li>
<li>Misuse of moderation tools</li>
<li>Reselling or distributing Vigil without permission</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Automated Actions & False Positives</h2>
<p>Vigil performs automated moderation actions based on security signals. False positives may occur.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rapid channel changes triggering anti-nuke protection</li>
<li>Mass joins triggering raid detection</li>
<li>High message activity triggering spam detection</li>
</ul>

<p>Server administrators are responsible for monitoring logs and correcting automated actions when needed.</p>

<h2>7. Backup and Restore</h2>

<h2>10. International Compliance</h2>
<p>Users must comply with applicable laws including GDPR, CCPA, and other regional regulations.</p>

<h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<p>Vigil is provided "as is" without warranties of reliability, uninterrupted service, or perfect restoration.</p>

<h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>The bot operator is not liable for indirect or consequential damages including data loss, false positives, downtime, or unauthorized access.</p>

<h2>13. Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>Disputes should first be resolved informally through direct communication before legal action.</p>

<h2>14. Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>India</strong>. Any disputes shall be subject to Indian courts.</p>

<h2>15. Modifications to the Service</h2>
<p>We may modify or discontinue Vigil at any time. Continued use constitutes acceptance of updated Terms.</p>

<h2>16. Termination</h2>
<p>You may remove Vigil at any time. We may block access for violations of these Terms.</p>

<h2>17. Contact</h2>

      <h1>🧾 Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 2026 · Also governed by the <a href="privacy.html" style="color:var(--accent)">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>By inviting, installing, or using Vigil ("the Bot", "we", "us"), you agree to these Terms of Service and the <a href="privacy.html" style="color:var(--accent)">Privacy Policy</a>. Both documents apply. If you do not agree, do not add or use Vigil.</p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 13 years of age and comply with Discord's Terms of Service. By using Vigil, you confirm you meet these requirements. You are responsible for ensuring you have permission to add bots to any server where Vigil is installed.</p>

      <h2>3. Description of Service</h2>
      <p>Vigil provides automated anti-nuke and anti-raid protection, quarantine and moderation tools, a three-tier permission system, server backup and restore functionality, a member verification gate, and security scoring. Vigil is provided as-is and may change at any time without notice.</p>

      <h2>4. Permitted Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Protecting your Discord server from malicious activity</li>
        <li>Running moderation actions through authorized commands</li>
        <li>Creating and restoring server configuration backups</li>
        <li>Setting up verification gates for new members</li>
        <li>Managing permission roles for trusted users</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Prohibited Use</h2>
      <p>You must not use Vigil to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Violate Discord's Terms of Service or Community Guidelines</li>
        <li>Harass, abuse, discriminate against, or harm other users</li>
        <li>Exploit Vigil's automated systems to target legitimate users</li>
        <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, modify, or tamper with the Bot</li>
        <li>Use Vigil for any purpose that is illegal under applicable law</li>
        <li>Use moderation tools for purposes unrelated to legitimate server moderation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Violations may result in your server being blocked from Vigil without prior notice.</p>

      <h2>6. Automated Actions &amp; False Positives</h2>
      <p>Vigil performs automated moderation actions based on security signals. By adding Vigil, you acknowledge that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automated actions may affect legitimate users — <strong>false positives can occur</strong></li>
        <li>A trusted admin rapidly reorganizing channels may trigger anti-nuke and be quarantined</li>
        <li>A large promotional influx of new accounts may be misidentified as a raid</li>
        <li>Multiple bots added quickly may trigger a bot-burst lockdown</li>
        <li>A user pasting large amounts of text may trigger message spam detection</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is the server administrator's responsibility to monitor Vigil's log channel, review automated actions, and reverse them when incorrect. Use <strong>/whitelist add</strong> for trusted users who may trigger thresholds.</p>

      <h2>7. Backup &amp; Restore</h2>
      <p>The restore process permanently deletes all current channels and roles before recreating them — <strong>this cannot be undone.</strong> Vigil does not back up message history or member lists. Discord CDN URLs for emojis and stickers may expire over time; very old backups may not fully restore all assets. It is your responsibility to verify backups before relying on them.</p>

      <h2>8. Permission Hierarchy &amp; Admin Responsibility</h2>
      <p>By granting users Owner-level or Trusted Admin permissions within Vigil, you accept full responsibility for all actions those users take. The bot operator is not responsible for misuse of permissions by users you authorize.</p>

      <h2>9. Hosting Responsibility</h2>
      <p>Bot operators are responsible for securing the hosting environment, safeguarding plain-text data files, managing data retention for inactive servers, and complying with applicable data protection laws. See the <a href="privacy.html" style="color:var(--accent)">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>

      <h2>10. International Compliance</h2>
      <p>Users and bot operators must comply with all applicable data privacy laws in their jurisdiction, including GDPR (EU &amp; UK) and CCPA (California, USA). It is the bot operator's responsibility to ensure their hosting and use of Vigil complies with local law.</p>

      <h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>Vigil is provided "as is" without any warranty of any kind. We do not warrant that Vigil will be error-free, uninterrupted, or always prevent security incidents. Automated actions may not always be accurate.</p>

      <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the bot operator shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including loss of server data, disruption from automated actions, false positives affecting legitimate users, or unauthorized access to hosting data files. Your use of Vigil is entirely at your own risk.</p>

      <h2>13. Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>We encourage resolving disputes informally first. Contact the bot operator directly — most issues can be resolved quickly. If direct contact does not resolve the issue within 14 days, both parties agree to attempt good-faith negotiation. If informal resolution fails, either party may pursue available legal remedies.</p>

      <h2>14. Governing Law &amp; Jurisdiction</h2>
      <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of <strong>India</strong>. Any unresolved disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts in India. Users outside India acknowledge their use may also be subject to local laws.</p>

      <h2>15. Modifications</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of Vigil after changes are published constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

      <h2>16. Termination</h2>
      <p>You may stop using Vigil at any time by removing it via Discord's Server Settings → Integrations. We reserve the right to block any server or user for violations of these Terms without prior notice.</p>

      <h2>17. Contact</h2>
      <p>For questions about these Terms, contact the bot operator through the platform where Vigil is deployed.</p>
